## Introduction

Welcome to the Medical Insurance Fraud Detection project! This project was developed as part of the Intelligent Database System course under the guidance of Professor Dr. Swathi. The objective of this project was to apply machine learning techniques to detect and filter out medical insurance fraud cases. Medical insurance fraud can lead to significant financial losses for insurance companies and affect genuine policyholders. Our team worked on building a fraud detection model to identify suspicious claims and improve the overall accuracy of the insurance system.

## Dataset

We collected the dataset from various sources, including historical insurance claims data, public healthcare datasets, and synthetic data to create a diverse and representative dataset. The dataset was merged and preprocessed to ensure that it is clean, balanced, and suitable for training machine learning models.

## Techniques Used

Our team employed the following machine learning techniques for fraud detection:

- **Targeted Detection and Filtering**: We utilized various supervised machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to target and identify potential fraudulent claims accurately.

- **Feature Engineering**: We engineered relevant features from the dataset to enhance the model's performance and improve the accuracy of fraud detection.

- **Model Evaluation**: We extensively evaluated the models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure the best possible performance.

- **Jupyter Notebook**: We used Jupyter Notebook to implement and execute the machine learning code, making it interactive and easy to analyze the results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, along with the necessary data science libraries.
3. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Medical_Insurance_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Train and evaluate the machine learning models for fraud detection.
